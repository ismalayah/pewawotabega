The first arrest, in 2008,&amp;nbsp;took place after the "Hot Tub Time Machine" actor was charged with possession of ecstasy and methamphetamines, per&amp;nbsp;People. In addition to possession, he was found "to be under the influence of&amp;nbsp;amphetamines, cocaine, and cannabinoids,"&amp;nbsp;the magazine reported. Lieutenant Carlos Reynosa of the Culver City Police Department confirmed the charges to People at the time.

Book II” doesn't seem willing to devote a whole movie to the same subject; it uses God as basically just a deus ex machina. He is, of course, enormously appealing, and George Burns is rich and understated in the role.
