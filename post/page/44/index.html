And then she dreams of a "real" landscape just like the one in her drawing, with the very same house, and with a sad boy's face in an upper window. She asks him to come outside. He cannot, because his legs will not move, and because she has not drawn any stairs in the house.
Found by a search party, Anna is returned home, where her behavior is explained by the fever she has developed.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Sylvester Stallone Hasn't Always Got Along With His Brother Frank</h2><time>May 2, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../sylvester-stallone-hasnt-always-got-along-brother-frank.html></a>
When Frank Stallone discussed his relationship with Sylvester Stallone, he did not think their "fights" were a big deal and chalked it up to "things that brothers do," as he said to Today Extra in 2021. According to Frank, any of their blow-ups just came with the territory for their lines of work. "You're both in show business, so you both have a certain ego," the singer said. Frank was also quick to point out that there was no resentment between the siblings.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Foxtrot movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2017)</h2><time>May 1, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../foxtrot-2017.html></a>
“Foxtrot” opens with a knock on a door. A woman, Daphna Feldmann (Sarah Adler), answers and immediately falls to the ground. She knows what the arrival of Israeli soldiers at her door means—her son Jonathan has died in the line of duty. The arriving soldiers confirm this news to Dafna’s husband Michael (the excellent Lior Ashkenazi), and Maoz’s formalism is instantly clear and striking. He opens his film with procedure. It’s not just the information of the death of a child but the procedure that entails.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>RoboCop movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1987)</h2><time>May 1, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../robocop-1987.html></a>
Because the scene surprises us in a movie that seemed to be developing into a serious thriller, it puts us off guard. We're no longer quite sure where "RoboCop" is going, and that's one of the movie's best qualities.
The film takes place at an unspecified time in the future in Detroit, a city where gang terror rules. There has been a series of brutal cop killings. A big corporation wants to market the robot cops to stamp out crime, but the demonstrator model obviously is not up to the job.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who Is Jannis Niewhner Girlfriend Emilia Schle?

<a href=../../../kuso-2017.html></a>
Produced over the course of two-and-a-half years, "Kuso" is a roiling stew of Flying Lotus's creative influences, some of whom have cameos in the film, like Heidecker and Funkadelic/Parliament co-founder George Clinton. All the events you see&nbsp;are somehow precipitated&nbsp;by a catastrophic Los Angeles earthquake. Beyond that, the only thing&nbsp;holding these scenes together are Ellison's&nbsp;recurring fixations with scab-and-pustule-encrusted nebbishes, and insects that emerge from rectal orifices. Watching "Kuso" consequently feels like an excavation of the many subterranean chambers of Ellison's anally-fixated imagination.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Mindhunter fans mourn as season 3 hopes squashed by David Fincher</h2><time>Apr 30, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../lack-of-legendary-pokemon-in-xy-167208.html></a>
It struck me as odd that there was no legendary trio (new for this generation). I loved the inclusion of Mewtwo, but it did feel like the legendaries were lacking, until we found out about the hidden legendaries, bringing the total up to 6. The original Red/Blue/Yellow only have 4/5 legendaries (whether you count Mew, or not, what with it's almost impossible to obtain status), and G/S/C only had 5/6 (whether you count Celebi or not, what with it's almost impossible to obtain status outside of Japan).</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/43/>← Prev Page</a>
