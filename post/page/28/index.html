Craig Robinson was arrested not once, but twice, in minor drug busts.

Lieutenant Carlos Reynosa of the Culver City Police Department confirmed the charges to People at the time.
Robinson would prove to be a very lucky man after getting a plea deal that took prison time completely off the table.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Mickey Rourkes appearance is being compared to everyone from Val Kilmer to Marjorie Taylor Greene</h2><time>Jun 22, 2024</time>

Mickey Rourke was interviewed on Fox Nation’s Piers Morgan Uncensored this week, if anyone was wondering exactly how long it would take before this story would go off the rails.
