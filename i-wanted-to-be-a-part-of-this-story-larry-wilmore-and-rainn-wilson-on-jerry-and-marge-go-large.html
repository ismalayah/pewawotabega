How do you create that chemistry of a long-term friendship?</strong></p><p>LW: Well, it's great because I already knew Bryan Cranston. When I was doing “The <a href=#>Bernie Mac</a> Show” and he was doing “Malcolm in the Middle,” and they were in a studio and we were in a basement. I used to see him all the time and we became friendly. But he is such a great actor, that relationship just happens. I didn't know Annette Bening. But here's somebody who is so fantastic, she creates a relationship like that. You're the putty in her capable little hands. And you just go, “I feel like I already know these people as characters.” You don't really have to do that much work when you're working with such talented cast.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s3.amazonaws.com/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/62a619aeb8b50d37d77d266f/content_JerryMarge.jpg><p><strong>How are your math skills? Did you understand the loophole Jerry discovered?</strong></p><p>LW: I was a math guy growing up. I was taking calculus as a sophomore in high school. But I stopped there and said, “Okay math, you've done your job, we've had enough of it.” I do like puzzles. My brain always likes to figure things out. And maybe the way that I write, too, is like figuring that puzzle out. And producing is like that a lot. When people say, “Larry, do you like performing or producing more?” I would say producing because it's figuring out the puzzle, putting those pieces together. “That's the right scene. Let's put that there.” And that appeals to my mind really a lot.</p><p><strong>Have you ever bought a lottery ticket?</strong></p><p>LW: Do I live in the United States of America? Of course. A lottery ticket? I think the proper question is, “Larry, how many lottery tickets do you unsuccessfully buy?”</p><p>RW: I think I bought maybe a dozen lottery tickets in my life, and maybe a half dozen scratchers. And I've never won a penny. So, I've given up on that and any kind of gambling.</p><p><strong>I was going to ask you how many winning tickets you've bought.</strong></p><p>LW: I'm very fortunate. I am luckier in what I have chosen to do for a living than I would if I had chosen to place my money in a bet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmoqakmr%2B3tcSwqmihXayur8DEnWStp12Xsm6tjKmYq6xdpLNuwMeiqmarpKS%2FunnLmqmrsV2stq25zqucZpmemXqzrcinpWavmaHAsLqMqKVmopWnv7p5wKebZqWRp7SmecaoZKWZopyy</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./american-pop-star-to-sing-tongan-national-anthem-at-league-semi-final.html><span>←</span><span>American pop star to sing Tongan national anthem at league semi-final</span></a>
