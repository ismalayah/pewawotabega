Surely, he can’t be a real person, can he?</p>Recommended Videos<h2 id=h-how-did-the-do-you-know-the-muffin-man-trend-begin data-injectable=false>How did the “Do you know the muffin man?” trend begin?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@rab_f href=#>@rab_f</a><p>Do you know! <a title=themuffinman href=#>#themuffinman</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Rab" href=#>♬ original sound – Rab</a></figure><p data-characters=478 data-current-count=778 data-injectable=true>This trend was started by a TikTok user known only as Rab (@rab_f). In their video, they claim to work with psychiatry patients in the ER while showing the viewers a hospital setting. As that goes on, we can hear someone out of the shot ask “Do you know the muffin man?”, and the person holding the camera asking back “The muffin man?” Promptly, the first voice replies much louder “The muffin man!” as the second one dissolves into laughter.</p><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=297 data-injectable=false>Currently, the video has over 4.1 million views, and over 598K likes. While there’s no telling if it is staged or not, many found the brief clip extremely entertaining, and have since replicated the scenario time and again. Meanwhile, others have taken the meme and put their own spin on it.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What is the “Do you know the muffin man” trend based on?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=597 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>Believe it or not, this trend is a reference to a nursery rhyme that has been around since the 19th century, aptly titled “The Muffin Man.” Toward the beginning of the children’s song, we can hear the familiar words spoken in the aforementioned TikTok video, accompanied by a catchy melody.</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=false>Now, not only will you get the TikTok sound stuck in your head, but it’s sung version, too. In the grand scheme of things, though, this is just one more of the numerous <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">songs that have achieved viral status</a> thanks to TikTok.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8tbXKraakq12ZvG7Fzq5kpKafrHq1tMRmpK6elp67brnAp2Ssp56ceqK6w2amq6GXnruiuIyer6mkkZ67prCO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pollyanna-mcintosh-walking-dead-bio-wiki-age-height-husband-net-worth-movies-and-tv-shows.html><span>←</span><span>Pollyanna McIntosh Walking Dead, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Movies and TV Shows</span></a>
