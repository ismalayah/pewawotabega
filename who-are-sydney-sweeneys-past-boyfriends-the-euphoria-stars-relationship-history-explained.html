They didn’t explain things to me, and that made me angry. So I acted out, but not in the way you would think. I was a straight-A student in all AP classes. I was valedictorian. I never went to a high school party. I’ve never done drugs, to this day. The acting-out Syd tried to find love through boys. I got myself into sometimes really unfortunate and even dangerous relationships.”</p><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>But she soon embraced self-love, accepting and acknowledging the importance of knowing how to love herself before finding someone to adore you the same way. Judging by the current status of her love life, she succeeded in accomplishing both.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-jonathan-davino-sydney-sweeney-s-fiance data-injectable=false>Who is Jonathan Davino, Sydney Sweeney’s fiance?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sydney-Sweeney-with-boyfriend-fiance-Jonathan-Davino.jpg><p data-characters=201 data-current-count=201 data-injectable=false>While Sweeney still has not officially addressed her relationship or gushed about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jonathan Davino</a> directly, the broad details about the love birds are out there in the form of some pretty solid rumors.</p><p data-characters=514 data-current-count=715 data-injectable=true>It all started with the link-up rumors when the duo was spotted at the Emmys party in L.A. back in 2018 and looking very much in love. The paps finding the couple together at different events and locations didn’t end — whether it was the PDA-filled <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">vacationing in Maui</a> or attending the Cannes Festival together — it was easy to add two and two together and come to the conclusion that Davino, a restauranteur, who is nowhere on social media, is the “not in the spotlight” guy Sweeney has been hinting at.</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>Again, though Sweeney (26) has not openly announced her engagement to Davino (40), back in March 2022, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> confirmed that she and her long-time boyfriend have gotten engaged. If spotting the Sharp Objects star with an engagement ring wasn’t enough, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">E! News</a> followed up on the news by sharing she was still “on cloud nine over her recent engagement to Jonathan.”&nbsp;</p><p>“It was a very intimate proposal, and she had no idea it was coming. They are really private about their relationship but are a great couple together.”</p><h2 id=h-but-what-about-the-sydney-sweeney-and-glen-powell-dating-rumors data-injectable=false>But what about the Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell dating rumors?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Sydney Sweeney (@sydney_sweeney)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=675 data-injectable=true>Remember how while promoting Scenes from a Marriage, Oscar Isaac sensually stroked Jessica Chastain’s arm on the Venice Film Festival red carpet? Unless you registered that detail in your fantasy and never followed up on it, you already know how both of them very committed relationships with different people at the time and all the PDA was for the sake of the film.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=230 data-injectable=false>Sweeney and Powell also armed themselves with a similar marketing tactic when rumors of them dating started floating in the wake of their rom-com, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Anyone But You</a>’s impending release. Why? <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Because “that’s what people want!”</a></p><p>“They want it. It’s fun to give it to ’em.”</p><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=673 data-injectable=false>Well, that’s Sweeney’s code to a happy love life — address the baseless rumors while ensuring that the real, actually priceless part of her private life is not up for gossip. Here’s hoping she will at least post pictures from her wedding day and not keep that under wraps as well because we are already hyperventilating thinking of Sweeney looking radiant as a beautiful bride.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMmqmeZaOusa%2Bx2GaqsJ2Vo7K6v4ypmKysXZe8urLRopynnKNiwamxjJ6sqaCfp7aiedKtmKurXaeyra3Toqanq5ievW60yKyrqKqpYrK5vMuaoKedlGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-accountant-2016.html><span>←</span><span>The Accountant movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2016)</span></a>
