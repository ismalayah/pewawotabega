This site is an elaborate joke that is no longer funny. We appreciate you dropping by.” The game was created by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Otter Space Productions</a>, a company comprised of roommates Michael Frederickson and Stephen Barlow.</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false>The two heard the song “Ni**as in Paris” and couldn’t get the lyric “Don’t let me into my zone” out of their head. They were inspired by the old school games Pac-Man and Pong. In an appearance on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One Life Left</a> Podcast, Fredrickson explained that the nature of the game and keeping Kanye out of the zone was a “philosophical” one.</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>He also called West an “arrogant man who purports to know everything” and that he shows “some ignorance” by not knowing exactly what happens if he gets in the zone. This was back in 2013, by the way, pre- all the anti-Jewish comments and Hitler loving.</p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=208 data-injectable=false>Of course, what was once funny is now not funny at all. While you may never get to play the game, there are a few videos of it in action on YouTube. It looks fun, but not fun enough to justify its existence.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=508 data-injectable=false></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2r7LApqauq12grq%2FFxGaxqKaVYrSiucRmq5qjlaN6sLLFpaCnnV2eu264yKCfrWWfm3qwusaooKefXZi8r8DRqK2eqqOesrR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./call-duty-escalation-zombie-mode-revealed.html><span>←</span><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops Escalation DLC Includes Buffy, Romero And More</span></a>
