Never in a million years did I think that I was going to find myself involved in drama. That is so not who I am. I just thought that I was able to be open and honest with a new friend about how I was feeling. As you saw, I acknowledged that everyone felt a connection to Gerry,&nbsp;and I welcomed that. We were all on a journey to see who was the best fit for Gerry… I never ever intended to make Kathy or anyone feel less than. As Edith said, ‘It’s the tension that we’re dating just one man.’&nbsp; Of course!”</p><p data-characters=149 data-current-count=149 data-injectable=false>She then proceeded to thank those who have supported her through this difficult time, sending her messages via Instagram and various other platforms.</p><p>“I appreciate the kind messages so much.&nbsp;I am grateful to all of you that could see that I had only good intentions and that I felt absolutely terrible when I realized I had hurt Kathy’s feelings… Thank you to my friends and family that know me and know that I would never mean to make someone else feel bad in any way, and to my new friends that can already see that in me as well.&nbsp; Love to all!”</p><p data-characters=62 data-current-count=62 data-injectable=false>Fortunately, it looks like this is all water under the bridge!</p><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=false>While we all anxiously await&nbsp;The Golden Wedding&nbsp;that is to come this evening — mostly to see what shenanigans Kathy Swarts and Charity Lawson will stir up on the red carpet — to relive the engagement between Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist, you can stream the the finale of the inaugural season of&nbsp;The Golden Bachelor now via Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ysrdOhsGarp5a%2Ftb%2BMsKClpF2svLO3jJqqZpldp7KlecKaqamdpGKwsL7Rnqqpp56Zsq%2FAjJqrZqyYmnqou8udnKdlp5qxpbXNoGSdnaOltrWxjJ%2Bmq6WVp3qnsdSdZLChpJ16o77InZxmrJiav6a%2FwGaloqukZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./juan-sebasti-c3-a1n-calero.html><span>←</span><span>Juan Sebastin Calero movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</span></a>
