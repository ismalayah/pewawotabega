<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Is Kagurabachi getting an anime?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p data-characters=740 data-injectable=true data-video=true>A new <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">manga</a> series is in town and it‚Äôs making a name for itself with only a single chapter out. Fresh from the mind of Takeru Hokazono, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kagurabachi</a></strong> had its first chapter published in Weekly Shonen Jump 2023 issue 42, which also published new chapters of already beloved series like One Piece, Jujutsu Kaisen, and My Hero Academia among others. In fact, Kagurabachi was the focus of the cover of this September issue, which showcases the red-eyed main character, Chihiro, holding his weapon of choice, a katana. It makes sense that Shonen Jump is making an effort to introduce the next hit series into the market, taking into consideration that some popular multi-volume manga, like My Hero Academia or Black Clover, are drawing to an end.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=221 data-current-count=221 data-injectable=false>It appears people have taken the bait. In fact, the interest had already been captured prior to the new magazine issue‚Äôs release, but since becoming available it has only reached new heights of manga fans‚Äô excitement.</p><p data-characters=542 data-current-count=763 data-injectable=true>Kagurabachi follows the katana-wielding protagonist on his bloody path to revenge. In the first chapter, we see what normal life was like for 14-year-old Chihiro as an apprentice to his blacksmith father, Rokuhira Kunishige. Then, without really knowing what took place in between, the story jumps forward in time. Chihiro has a scar on the side of his face that wasn‚Äôt there before and his disposition seems changed. It‚Äôs implicit that something might‚Äôve happened to his father and that may be the reason why he is now seeking revenge.</p><h2 id=h-is-kagurabachi-getting-adapted data-injectable=false><strong>Is Kagurabachi getting adapted?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Captura-de-ecra-2023-09-20-120235-1-1-edited.png><p data-characters=558 data-current-count=858 data-injectable=true>There have been rumors that none other than Studio MAPPA has picked up the series for adaptation. However, an official confirmation from the Japanese studio has yet to come out. It wouldn‚Äôt be surprising for an animation studio like MAPPA to call dibs on a shonen like this one, considering their work in series like Jujutsu Kaisen or Hell‚Äôs Paradise, Kagurabachi seems to be right up their alley. Speaking of Jujutsu Kaisen, Kurabachi also includes sorcerers capable of magical abilities, which the main character pairs with his incredible sword skills.</p><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>Judging by everything we can see online, and how much discourse a single manga chapter has generated, Kagurabachi is sure to get animated and it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising if MAPPA did it. Some fans online have declared that the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">anime</a> is in the works but this is unlikely. A Twitter user who spread the news called it ‚Äúsuccessful bait‚Äù the next day.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>‚ÄúKAGURABACHI‚Äù TV Anime has been officially confirmed to be in the works at MAPPA Studios. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/H7WhMWzuhk</a></p>‚Äî boy üáµüá∏ (@EPICBOYOBOYO) <a href=#>September 17, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>On Reddit, the discussion is also ongoing. Redditor<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> u/SnowyJKN</a> posted a frame of what they call an ‚Äúanime leak,‚Äù however, there is no way to assure this is real, and in all likelihood, it isn‚Äôt. As another user, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">u/MarioCop718</a> ironically commented on the thread: ‚ÄúSo nice that this is finally getting an adaptation after being 2 days old.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=227 data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true>On YouTube, English voice actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Aleks Lee</a> shared a fan video made by Zactun on TikTok, in which he voices Chihiro. Not only does it look and sound incredible, it is also a potential tease of things to come in an unknown future.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=50 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>There‚Äôs also an official PV trailer that is out.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=650 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kagurabachi PV.</p><p>Series launched this week in Weekly Shonen Jump Issue #42. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/A6PfHf3Hxy</a></p>‚Äî Shonen Jump News (@WSJ_manga) <a href=#>September 18, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>While we can‚Äôt confirm that an anime is in the works, as every trail of indication leads to something that‚Äôs not truly substantial, it nevertheless wouldn‚Äôt be released anytime soon.
