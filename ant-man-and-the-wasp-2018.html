<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Ant-Man and the Wasp movie review (2018)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Macho pride may be a generic flaw for a superhero movie, but "Ant-Man and the Wasp" is the rare super-film in which actions have consequences, and the characters overcome&nbsp;their ego-driven tendencies long enough to work together as a raggedy team. Supporting characters—like smug weapons dealer Sonny Burch (<a href=#>Walton Goggins</a>), mysterious super-villain Ghost (<a href=#>Hannah John-Kamen</a>), clueless FBI agent Jimmy Woo (<a href=#>Randall Park</a>), and Pym's estranged former colleague Dr. Bill Foster (<a href=#>Laurence Fishburne</a>)—frequently throw Lang and Pym off their best-laid plans, particularly their shared goal of&nbsp;securing the equipment that Pym needs to&nbsp;rescue&nbsp;his long-missing wife Janet (<a href=#>Michelle Pfeiffer</a>) from the trippy,&nbsp;sub-atomic (and very dangerous) Quantum&nbsp;Realm.</p><p>But&nbsp;the discursive, tangent-filled nature of Lang's story is&nbsp;the most charming aspect of&nbsp;"Ant-Man and the Wasp." Lang's&nbsp;narrative&nbsp;is a revolving door of well-meaning outsiders—here comes his&nbsp;ex-wife Maggie (<a href=#>Judy Greer</a>) and her&nbsp;amiable&nbsp;wet blanket husband Paxton (<a href=#>Bobby Cannavale</a>) with Lang’s eager-to-please daughter Cassie (<a href=#>Abby Ryder Fortson</a>)—and neurotic colleagues, like Lang’s "X-Con" security crew team of Kurt (<a href=#>David Dastmalchian</a>), Dave (T.I.), and Luis (<a href=#>Michael Peña</a>, predictably stealing every scene he's in). Many of these characters are also struggling to suppress their own habitual catastrophizing: if Ghost doesn’t steal and fire up Pym’s equipment now, she will die; if Pym doesn’t get Lang’s help in recovering his equipment, his wife will vanish; and if Lang doesn’t get back to his house before Woo returns to check up on him, his new post-“Ant-Man” life is over.</p><p>Thankfully, director <a href=#>Peyton Reed</a> (“<a href=#>Bring It On</a>,” “<a href=#>Down with Love</a>”) and the film’s five credited screenwriters capably (though not always gracefully) juggle these various plot points. They don’t develop every thread, but they do follow through with enough subplots and ideas that most moviegoers will be superficially invested in the characters by the time “Ant-Man and the Wasp” inevitably devolves into a series of well-choreographed set pieces.</p><p>There are, however, several scenes during the film’s first half where Reed and his writers don’t meaningfully advance Lang’s character development beyond pushing their messy plot along. During these early scenes, Lang randomly loses control of his super-suit, and consequently behaves like a sulky, Peter Parker-like post-adolescent. He also sometimes behaves like a relatively mature caregiver who relishes taking care of his daughter and sighs heavily whenever he can’t independently figure out how to solve his domestic problems. "Ant-Man and the Wasp"&nbsp;arguably doesn't do enough to reconcile the difference between these two dueling aspects of Lang’s personality.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46apa1lnZa7bq3NnWStoJVixKK%2Fz2ZpaWlo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./where-does-ruby-franke-from-the-8-passengers-youtuber-channel-live.html><span>←</span><span>Where does Ruby Franke from the 8 Passengers YouTuber channel live?</span></a>
