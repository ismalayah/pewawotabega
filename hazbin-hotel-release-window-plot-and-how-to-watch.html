Like a Disney Princess caught in a drug-induced nightmare, the sweet and gentle demon princess has an impossible dream. Charlie wants to try and rehabilitate the many forgotten souls in The Pentagram and give them a chance at going to heaven rather than suffer “The Purge” – <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">just like the one you’re thinking of</a> – &nbsp;an annual event where Angels enter Hell and cull the ever-increasing population. Upset by the idea of her subjects being slaughtered, Charlie opens the “Happy Hotel” with the help of her girlfriend and publicist, Vaggie.</p><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true>When her clients “check out” of the hotel, they will hopefully be released from Hell and free to start over in Heaven. Her first problematic client is Angel Dust, an adult film actor with a bad attitude and a moral compass that only points south. When the Radio Demon, Alistair, arrives to offer his help in achieving achieve Charlie’s dreams, her wild ambitions could either become a shining reality, or come crashing down around her.</p><h2 id=h-where-can-i-watch-hazbin-hotel data-injectable=false>Where can I watch Hazbin Hotel?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=701 data-current-count=1001 data-injectable=false>As of right now, all of right now, you can watch the pilot for free on YouTube with the link above.

Though the singular episode is just 30 minutes long and dropped in 2019, the odd premise, colorful cast, and unique art style almost immediately spawned a fan following. While Hazbin Hotel didn’t immediately take off, it did spawn two separate spin-offs, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">webcomic Dirty Healings</a> that follows Angel Dust, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Helluva Boss</a>.
