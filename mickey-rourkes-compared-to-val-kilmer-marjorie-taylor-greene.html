Recommended Videos Though Rourke has been acting for over four decades and has worked with directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, and Darren Aronofsky, his career of late seems to be relegated mostly to B action movies, and he doesn’t seem like the most suitable peer to comment on another actor’s career."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

But comment he did!</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=710 data-injectable=true>“I don’t care about money and power,” Rourke told Morgan. “I care about when I watch Al Pacino working, Chris Walken, De Niro’s early work, Richard Harris’ work, Ray Winstone’s work — that’s the kind of actor I want to be, like Monty Clift, Brando back in the day. A lot of guys that just tried to stretch as actors.”</p><p data-characters=159 data-current-count=159 data-injectable=false>“You don’t think he’s [Cruise] a good actor?” Morgan asked. “I think he’s irrelevant, in my world,” Rourke responded.</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=388 data-injectable=false>Sure, maybe he has something close to a valid a point in there — Tom Cruise is less of an actor and more of an action star these days — but irrelevant? Hardly.

Rourke famously underwent reconstructive surgery in the aughts to fix his injuries from boxing, though it appears as though he may have overcorrected. And while it may be unkind to make fun of someone over their looks, the 9½ Weeks star wasn’t not asking for it by criticizing Cruise’s career.</p><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=188 data-injectable=false>As such, people on Twitter compared Rourke to everyone from “a Keith Urban cake on Nailed It” and “Kato Kaelin out of Play-Doh” to Marjorie Taylor Greene and so on.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Mickey Rourke looks like someone tried to make a Keith Urban cake on Nailed It <a href=#>https://t.co/TKWot0KwUY</a></p>— Louis Virtel (@louisvirtel) <a href=#>July 12, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Mickey Rourke looks like if you made Kato Kaelin out of Play-Doh <a href=#>https://t.co/jWmPtgkfU9</a></p>— Matt Oswalt (@MattOswaltVA) <a href=#>July 11, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’m not saying Mickey Rourke and Marjorie Taylor Greene are the same person.
