According to the casting page, the “Front Man” is looking for English-speaking participants around the globe over the age of 21 years old to join the games. If you are interested in playing, here is what you need to do.</p><p data-characters=519 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true>The first step is to visit&nbsp;Squid Game: The Challenge&nbsp;casting page on <a href=#>www.squidgamecasting.com</a>. There, you will be presented with three online portals – USA, UK, and Global casting. From there, you need to put in your details as well as agree with the terms of use and privacy statement. You also need to confirm that you are 21 years old and older, and must be available for at least four weeks in early 2023. You must have a valid passport and that you’re not affiliated with Netflix or All3 Media Group.</p><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>You are then to submit a one-minute video where you introduce yourself and explain why you want to join the games, what’s your game plan, and what would you use your winnings for. You are also then to submit a headshot and a full-body photo. You don’t have to be an athlete or really skilled. Anyone who is a fan of the show and wants to take that gamble can sign up.</p><p data-characters=434 data-current-count=813 data-injectable=true>Unlike the K-drama,&nbsp;Squid Game: The Challenge&nbsp;isn’t looking for anyone who is in massive debt or is being chased by loan sharks. They are looking for keen participants who saw the show, saw the YouTube recreations, and are still keen to join in. Netflix made it clear in their application portal that no contestant will get hurt. So if you think you can pass all six games and win that grand prize, now is the time to sign up.</p><p data-characters=90 data-current-count=90 data-injectable=false>And just to confirm: no one is going to be killed. If you lose, you simply leave a loser.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yzscCdsGasn2LEqrqMbWRubl2itq24yKilZqCVp7K0eceormasn2KutrDIraCopl2bvLN5zZ6rn6SZrcBuv9CuoJ1ll5a6pnnRnpiloaSuerS0zrBm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charlie-villanueva-bio-age-wife-kids-disease-hair-nba-and-net-worth-2.html><span>←</span><span>Charlie Villanueva Bio, Age, Wife, Kids, Disease, Hair, NBA, and Net Worth</span></a>
