<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Birthmarked movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2018)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>What the title of the film doesn’t completely achieve, the Disney saying does: it subtly spells out the themes of Desmarais’ film before its adequately amusing humor (through a script penned by <a href=#>Marc Tulin</a>) introduces the viewer to the younger selves of the now-parents Catherine (<a href=#>Toni Collette</a>) and Ben (<a href=#>Matthew Goode</a>). Both coming from a long line of prestigious scientists, the two high-IQed scholars meet in graduate school and prove to make a perfect match in the lab as well as the bedroom. Allured by the idea of proving the ultimate power of “nurture” over “nature,” the pair decides to raise an unusual family, infusing their children with the necessary tools and knowledge to challenge their genetic predispositions. Can you really grow up to be something you’re not born as? Catherine and Ben quit their jobs and jointly elect a life dedicated to proving that no one has to be obstructed or defined by their lineage.</p><p>Enter the eccentric millionaire/scientist Gertz (<a href=#>Michael Smiley</a>), who agrees to fund the research project for his own set of mysterious scientific goals. Soon enough, Catherine and Ben (expecting a baby) move to the countryside with their Russian research assistant Samsonov (<a href=#>Andreas Apergis</a>), and adopt two kids, whom they’d raise alongside their own biological son Luke (Jordan Poole) like lab rats. Luke gets put on a steady diet of highbrow art. When upset, he is asked to sing his feelings out. His science-leaning genes get completely disregarded. Maya (Megan O’Kelly), despite not being the offspring of intellectuals, is asked to engage with everything from a brainy, rational lens and is fed foods with high iron value to enhance her cognitive development. Maurice (<a href=#>Anton Gillis-Adelman</a>), on the other hand, is encouraged to channel his violent leanings (which he inherited from his biological parents) towards peaceful harmony. But would the 12-year-long experiment to nurture an accomplished artist, a brainy intellectual and a peace-loving pacifist ultimately work?</p><p>Don’t expect “Birthmarked” to resolve into an earth-shattering conclusion. It’s not likely to challenge your balanced views on the topic of “nurture” vs. “nature” when the kids act up in benign ways and get into trouble for listening to Iron Maiden. But for what it’s worth, Hoss-Desmarais’ film does provide some quirky laughs along the way, accompanied by <a href=#>Fionnula Flanagan</a>’s fairy-tale-esque voiceover narration. It’s a highly fanciful package that might fool you into thinking that you’re in whimsical <a href=#>Wes Anderson</a> territory where kids revolt and teach their elders a lesson they won’t forget.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46boKusmKKus7fEnWRraGFt</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alix-earles-net-worth-confirmed.html><span>←</span><span>Alix Earles net worth confirmed</span></a>
