The first arrest, in 2008,&nbsp;took place after the "Hot Tub Time Machine" actor was charged with possession of ecstasy and methamphetamines, per&nbsp;<a href=#>People</a>. In addition to possession, he was found "to be under the influence of&nbsp;amphetamines, cocaine, and cannabinoids,"&nbsp;the magazine reported. Lieutenant Carlos Reynosa of the Culver City Police Department confirmed the charges to People at the time.</p><p>Robinson would prove to be a very lucky man after getting a plea deal that took prison time completely off the table. The actor&nbsp;only had to plead guilty to possession of ecstasy and complete a drug diversion program to get all charges dropped.</p><p>But five years later, Robinson was busted trying to leave the Bahamas for the U.S. while carrying marijuana and ecstasy pills, per the&nbsp;<a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a>. Stephen Dean of the Royal Bahamas Police Force was very cavalier about the arrest, stating to the Los Angeles Times that it was "nothing major." Robinson once again skirted serious legal ramifications, including the possibility of four years in prison. After paying a $1,000 fine, he left the country. And it seems that "The Masked Dancer" host has since learned from his mistakes, with no further legal trouble.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWlnbIBxe9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2Yv6K1xmapqJqZo8CwutJmo56fkaF6tb7OrpmlnaNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./percy-annabeth-and-grover-link-up-in-new-on-set-footage-of-percy-jackson-and-the-olympians.html><span>←</span><span>Percy, Annabeth, and Grover link up in new on-set footage of Percy Jackson and the Olympians</span></a>
