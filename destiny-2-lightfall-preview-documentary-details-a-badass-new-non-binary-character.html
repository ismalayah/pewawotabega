Here’s how Bungie’s Liz Baker and Melissa Chan describe them:</p><p>“Rohan is the grizzled old veteran who’s too old for this sh*t, and Nimbus is the young rookie, learning on the job. Nimbus was definitely a favorite of ours to animate, they’re so boisterous and fun-loving, and a little smug, but super confident in their abilities. The Cloud Striders, bottom line, are ******* cool.”</p><p data-characters=544 data-current-count=873 data-injectable=true>You can see Nimbus and Rohan in action in the below video, and the pair are indeed some of the coolest characters to be introduced into Destiny for quite some time. They’re extremely agile and colorful and fly around on hoverboards as the defenders of a neon metropolis. What’s not to love?&nbsp;Sure, we’re finally facing off against the Witness, the big bad that Bungie has been building up for almost a decade, but it’s still nice to see some variety <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">(and broad representation</a>) in what is more often than not a grimdark game.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=713 data-injectable=true>Those that have witnessed the closing moments of Destiny 2’s Season of the Seraph know that the stakes have never been higher for the Last City, its Guardians, the Traveler, and the entire Sol system. As a result, it looks like Lightfall is set to potentially be the most action-packed Destiny expansion since the days of The Taken King and the since-removed Red War campaign which Destiny 2 shipped with.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>Add to that a refreshingly colorful locale to explore, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">insane mobility thanks to the new Strand subclass</a>, Destiny 2: Lightfall is hopefully shaping up to be something truly special. The expansion releases on Feb. 28, 2023, for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X, and PC.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZom56rpJ67unmRZqOin5ips6K4y2anq52mnrK4ecOomq6llaPBor7YZpuerJGeubR5wGaZmpyRqMBuusSwZKennmKvqrrAq7Bmm5iWv6Kv056paA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./actor-logan-williams-wiki-age-family-cause-of-death-net-worth-height-parents-instagram-the-flash-obituary-and-funeral.html><span>←</span><span>Actor Logan Williams Wiki, Age, Family, Cause of Death, Net Worth, Height, Parents, Instagram, The F</span></a>
