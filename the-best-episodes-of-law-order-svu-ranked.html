Season 12, episode 3: “Behave”</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=620 data-current-count=920 data-injectable=true>Jennifer Love Hewitt makes a cameo appearance on “Behave” as Vicki, a woman who was reportedly raped and claimed that the same man has sexually attacked her on several occasions over the course of several years. What made this episode particularly memorable is the impact of Hewitt’s performance, especially when she delivered the lines “Now I’ll always know where you are. Be a good boy. Behave yourself” back to her assailant, freeing herself from fear and finally getting justice. “Behave” also features a really well-executed scene where she describes her past trauma.</p><h2 id=h-6-season-11-episode-12-shadow data-injectable=false>6. Season 11, episode 12: “Shadow”</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=857 data-current-count=1157 data-injectable=true>Guest starring Lost‘s Naveen Andrews as detective Ashok Ramsey from the Special Frauds Unit, “Shadow” begins with an affluent couple discovered dead in their bedroom, the apparent victims of a murder-suicide. Sarah Paulson appears as Anne, the grieving daughter of the couple. As Benson and Stabler dive deeper into the unlikely circumstances surrounding the deaths, they begin to see that all may not be as it originally appeared, and Anne is looking to be their main suspect. A standout for the chemistry between Benson and Ramsey, even though this was a Munich-free episode, “Shadow” made it to our list for getting our heart racing, thinking that Benson got shot, and mercifully, the “Lick my boot…LICK IT!” line that was so heavily touted in the NBC promo teases for this episode didn’t make it to the screen.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>5. Season 6, episode 6: “Conscience”</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=540 data-current-count=840 data-injectable=true>In “Conscience,” Kyle McLachlan appears as Dr. Brett Morton, a psychotherapist and father of a child murdered by 13-year-old Jake O’Hara. Morton wants the teen who killed his son imprisoned after learning he is a psychopath with no remorse. As Jake’s trial progresses, he realizes that the court will treat the teenager kindly because he is a minor. Seeing that Jake will be released in five years and will likely kill again, Morton decides to take the law into his own hands. This episode will leave you speechless.</p><h2 id=h-4-season-5-episode-4-loss data-injectable=false>4. Season 5, episode 4: “Loss”</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=713 data-injectable=true>“Loss” begins with the rape and murder of an undercover federal agent investigating a brutal Colombian drug cartel. Rafael Zapata is arrested by the police while Alex Cabot is determined to make progress in the cartel member case despite the risks. The FBI takes over the investigation because she and her loved ones receive horrific death threats. This thrilling episode would be Cabot’s last.</p><h2 id=h-3-season-17-episode-23-heartfelt-passages data-injectable=false>3.

Mike Dodds’ final episode, “Heartfelt Passages,” continues the story of Gary Munson, a correctional officer accused of sexually abusing inmates at a women’s jail.

The perpetrator leads the police to a scene where a baby is found in a stroller with a message saying the baby’s mother has been kidnapped and challenging the police to find him. The murderer’s signature, “Rupert Daniel Kilmore,” leads investigators to a watchmaker and a local drug user, who provide them more pieces to a riddle that must be solved to save the life of the young mother, played by Elizabeth Franz.</p><h2 id=h-1-season-7-episode-3-911 data-injectable=false>1.
