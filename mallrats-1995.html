But she can't go: Her father (<a href=#>Michael Rooker</a>) produces a game show called "Truth or Date," and she's needed as an emergency guest. It's all T.S.' fault.</p><p>Her friend Julie was scheduled to do the show, but T.S. told her she was fat, and that so disturbed her, she died of an embolism.</p><p>T.S.' best friend is Brodie (<a href=#>Jason Lee</a>), a kid so addicted to video games that he hardly notices his girlfriend, Rene (<a href=#>Shannen Doherty</a>). Both guys fall out with their girls and escape to the mall, which is populated by a predictable population of nerdy clerks and incompetent security guards. One nice touch is a friend of theirs who stands for hours in front of one of those Magic Eye posters, trying desperately to see the 3-D image.</p><p>The story then involves Rooker's attempts to stage a taping of the game show in the mall, while T.S. and Brodie meanwhile try either to patch things up with their girlfriends or to make new ones.</p><p>The day involves encounters with the Easter Bunny and a topless fortune teller with three nipples, and there is a moment of truth when T.S. meets <a href=#>Stan Lee</a>, legendary creator of many Marvel Comics heroes, and learns that even the great Stan was a teenager once, and drew his superheroes as a way of forgetting his first girlfriend.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46mmKWkopbBtHmQcnBu</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christine-hammontree-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-88351-html.html><span>←</span><span>Christine Hammontree Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
