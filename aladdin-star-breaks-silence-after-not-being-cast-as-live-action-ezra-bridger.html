Having generally avoided being drawn into the scuttlebutt since his name first started getting bandied around, the Jack Ryan alum admitted that he’s glad a line can now be drawn under the constant rumors.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Glad the rumors will stop now.

On the plus side, we now have our Ezra Bridger, and while his debut hasn’t been confirmed, it wouldn’t exactly be a shock were it to be confirmed later today <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">that he’ll be joining Natasha Liu Bordizzo’s Sabine Wren and Rosario Dawson’s title hero in Ahsoka</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yiuMCdm6KmXajBor6Mm6memZuoerS1y56lnJ1dlrO1sdFmpaisXZeyqrrGZpqaq6RirrR5y6KtnmWRmMGqu81mnLOqkWKvs7XDoJyrZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./andrija-kuzmanovic-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Andrija Kuzmanovic Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
