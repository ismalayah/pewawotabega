Picard Season 3 gained series-best reviews and topped streaming charts. Any spin-off show would have the immediate support of legions of fans. With the Trek universe continuing to expand with the recently announced Section 31 movie (starring Oscar winner Michelle Yeoh), as well as Star Trek: Starfleet Academy, it is looking increasingly likely that some kind of Picard spinoff will happen.</p><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=269 data-injectable=false>If it were to go ahead, Legacy would put to rest 24th Century-era Trek and allow modern writers to show what the 25th Century galaxy has to offer.
