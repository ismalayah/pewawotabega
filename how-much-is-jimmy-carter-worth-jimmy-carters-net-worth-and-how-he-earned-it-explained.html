Recently, the 39th and longest-lived former president announced he was entering care for the end of his days and with his passing imminent, many are wondering just how much this public figure who many see as a better man than he was a president is worth, financially speaking.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=959 data-current-count=959 data-injectable=true>To begin with, as the still-living 98-year-old as of this article’s filing is a private citizen, any wealth estimation is hard to precisely determine given a lack of public finance disclosure rules when one is not seeking an elected position. One outlet estimates it to be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$60 million</a>, another has it at $5 million and a different publication puts it <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">around $10 million</a>. More precise information will likely come out in the future, but official sources on Carter’s earlier years do confirm he, wife Rosalyn and their three sons <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">did have</a> to live in public housing at one point before his political career took off. Once it did, he put his main asset (a peanut farm) into a blind trust in order to avoid conflicts of interest (seems quaint by today’s standards doesn’t it?) but those who managed it did not steer the thing with any sort of prudence and after he returned to the company in 1981 he was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$1 million in debt and nearly</a> broke.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=517 data-current-count=817 data-injectable=true>So, with his back against the wall and needing something, Carter took a page from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">former President Ulysses S. Grant</a> and wrote. Either by himself or with his wife, he has written more than 10 books ranging from poetry to children’s content and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">history fiction</a>. Given his position and the fact he and his family still <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">live in a house</a> worth less than $200,000, it is likely he received some hefty advances and put portions of the money into investments when not working with his foundation or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Habitat for Humanity</a>.</p><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=246 data-injectable=false>Certainly, while not perfect, Carter leaves a legacy in the same way those who have come after and before him have. It will certainly be debated, and, whatever the case may be, you cannot deny the man rose from obscurity and has stayed very busy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMpqycoF2ewG62yKaksmWTlr%2B1sdFmrqiqpJ16q7XMprBmm5Gnwaa%2B0malnqxdrLyzwMdmmKecXZ28uHnHnmSemaKjsqV5yK1knrCgoa6qusSdZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gary-entin.html><span>←</span><span>Getting To Know About Gary Entin - Net Worth, Bio and Facts</span></a>
