Macho pride may be a generic flaw for a superhero movie, but "Ant-Man and the Wasp" is the rare super-film in which actions have consequences, and the characters overcome&nbsp;their ego-driven tendencies long enough to work together as a raggedy team. Supporting characters—like smug weapons dealer Sonny Burch (Walton Goggins), mysterious super-villain Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), clueless FBI agent Jimmy Woo (Randall Park), and Pym's estranged former colleague Dr. Bill Foster (Laurence Fishburne)—frequently throw Lang and Pym off their best-laid plans, particularly their shared goal of&nbsp;securing the equipment that Pym needs to&nbsp;rescue&nbsp;his long-missing wife Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) from the trippy,&nbsp;sub-atomic (and very dangerous) Quantum&nbsp;Realm.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India movie review (2002)</h2><time>Jun 5, 2024</time>

"The Aviator" celebrates Scorsese's zest for finding excitement in a period setting, re-creating the kind of glamor he heard about when he was growing up.
