The last season of “You’re the Worst” is about the (finally) pending nuptials of writer Jimmy Shive-Overly (Chris Geere) and publicist Gretchen Cutler (Aya Cash), but it’s not your traditional wedding planning. In fact, the season premiere mostly concerns one of the elaborate stories that Jimmy and Gretchen tell to wedding planners about how they met. The season allows for a few new subplots, but it regularly comes back to planning the wedding and the complications that ensue, as well as the constant worry that they won’t actually make it to the altar.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>If you thought Gorr looked creepy, this Thor 4 concept art shows just how strange things could</h2><time>Jul 16, 2024</time>

When Neil Gaiman was writing The Sandman comics in the 1990s, he played the long game and set up certain plotlines early into the series’ run that he only paid off much later down the line.
