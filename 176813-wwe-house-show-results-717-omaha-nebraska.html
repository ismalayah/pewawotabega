WWE brought the WWE Supershow to Omaha, NE the night before the first annual Money in the Bank PPV and they delivered a really good show.
In the opener Christian d. Cody Rhodes. Huge opening match pop for Christian coming out and good heat for Rhodes. Really good match and pretty long opener going about 15 mins. After a few counters Christian won with the Killswitch."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Cody Rhodes. Huge opening match pop for Christian coming out and good heat for Rhodes. Really good match and pretty long opener going about 15 mins. After a few counters Christian won with the Killswitch.</p><p>Santino Marella d. Zack Ryder. Good short match seeing a headlock dominate early. People were into both, Zack Ryder considerably more than his push. Finish saw Santino win with THE COBRA~! to the delight and surprise of most. WOW!</p><p>U.S. Title Match: The Miz d. Evan Bourne and Mark Henry in a impromptu triple threat match to retain the U.S. Title. The Miz came out for some mic work saying Omaha didn’t deserve to see The Miz, Evan Bourne didn’t deserve a title shot and bragging that he took out Mark Henry on Raw and that he was going to win Money in the Bank tomorrow. This led to Mark Henry coming out and being added to the match, which is a stretch since he selling on the outside most of the match.The finish saw Bourne hit Mark Henry with the Shooting Star Press and Miz pulled him off and hit the Skull Crushing Finale for the win in under 10 minutes. Good match.</p><p>The Hart Dynasty d. The Usos. Usual good Hart Dyansty match, and the Uso’s really delivered as well delivering some nice double team moves. The finish came when Tamina tried to distract Harry, then Natalya pulled her of the apron and took her down. Tyson Kidd then dove on one Uso as Harry applied the Sharp shooter for the win in about 10 minutes.</p><p>John Morrison d. Ted Dibiase w/ Maryse. Maryse is as advertised live, great addition to Dibiase! Short match which saw Morrison win with the Star Ship Pain in under 10 minutes.</p><p>Jillian Hall and Justin Roberts threw out merchandise going into the intermission.</p><p>Kofi Kingston d. Drew McIntyre, Matt Hardy and Dolph Ziggler. Drew McIntyre did a pre-match promo urging the crowd to urge us back into our seats to see him wrestle, which drew big heat. The finish saw Matt Hardy hit McIntyre with the Twist of Fate, Dolph hit Hardy with the Zig Zag and Kofi Kingston hit the Trouble in Paradise for the win. Very good match.</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>WWE Womens Title match: Alicia Fox d. Eve Torres via Axe kick to retain the title. Ok match with good effort by both including a standing moonsault from Eve and some good bumps by Alicia.</p><p>Main Event: Cena, Orton, Mysterio and Big Show NC Sheamus, Edge, Chris Jericho and Jack Swagger when the Nexus ran in and jumped both teams. Pre-match Jericho found a Oklahoma hat and gave it to Jack Swagger for HUGE HEAT. Good match going over 20 minutes. Everyone hit there finishers leading to Nexus hitting the ring as Cena had Sheamus in the STF. The locker room, including Christian and Santino in street clothes, cleared the ring of Nexus to end the show.</p><p>Fun Show.</p><p>Best Match: Christian vs. Rhodes</p><p>Worst Match: Alicia vs. Eve</p><p>Biggest Pops: Cena, Orton and Santino</p><p>Most Heat: Jack Swagger, The Miz and Drew McIntyre</p><p>I also went to the MITB PPV in KC.</p><p>Really good show. Orton was the most over on the show, not surprising since he’s from St. Louis. Bourne was booed a bit and he’s from St. Louis too, so the crowd may of just been into Orton.</p><p>Post PPV the Nexus came in to clean up their mates and Wade Barrett essentially said to watch out for them on Raw. Many tickets available in every price range, including my friend getting front row seats for $80. Very hot crowd through out. Anti-Cena crowd as the fans were probably 60 to 40 with a lets go Sheamus chant to start out, kinda strange since Cena was super over in Omaha though there were clearly way more hardcore fans here. Somewhat anti-climatic main even to end the show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZZvb2prXazEpnnHqKysnV2otbDDjKucrK2cqcBug5BwZKilkZ2ubrrEm6maq5uW</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vahbbiz-dorabjee-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-364863-html.html><span>←</span><span>Vahbbiz Dorabjee Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
