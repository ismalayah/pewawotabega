<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>The Aviator movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2004)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>"The Aviator" celebrates Scorsese's zest for finding excitement in a period setting, re-creating the kind of glamor he heard about when he was growing up. It is possible to imagine him wanting to be Howard Hughes. Their lives, in fact, are even a little similar: Heedless ambition and talent when young, great early success, tempestuous romances and a dark period, although with Hughes it got darker and darker, while Scorsese has emerged into the full flower of his gifts.</p><p>The movie achieves the difficult feat of following two intersecting story arcs, one in which everything goes right for Hughes and the other in which everything goes wrong. Scorsese chronicled similar life patterns in "<a href=#>GoodFellas</a>," "<a href=#>Raging Bull</a>," "<a href=#>The King of Comedy</a>," "<a href=#>Casino</a>," actually even "<a href=#>The Last Temptation of Christ</a>." <a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a> is convincing in his transitions between these emotional weathers; playing madness is a notorious invitation to overact, but he shows Hughes contained, even trapped, within his secrets, able to put on a public act even when his private moments are desperate.</p><p>His Howard Hughes arrives in Los Angeles as a good-looking young man with a lot of money, who plunges right in, directing a World War I aviation adventure named "Hell's Angels," which was then the most expensive movie ever made. The industry laughed at him, but he finished the movie and it made money, and so did most of his other films. As his attention drifted from movies to the airplanes in his films, he began designing and building aircraft and eventually bought his own airline.</p><p>Women were his for the asking, but he didn't go for the easy kill. Jean Harlow was no pushover, <a href=#>Ava Gardner</a> wouldn't take gifts of jewelry ("I am not for sale!"), and during his relationship with <a href=#>Katharine Hepburn</a>, they both wore the pants in the family. Hepburn liked his sense of adventure, she was thrilled when he let her pilot his planes, she worried about him, she noted the growing signs of his eccentricity, and then she met <a href=#>Spencer Tracy</a> and that was that. Hughes found <a href=#>Jane Russell</a> and invented a pneumatic bra to make her bosom heave in "The Outlaw," and by the end he had starlets on retainer in case he ever called them, but he never did.</p><p>DiCaprio is nobody's idea of what Hughes looked like (that would be a young <a href=#>Sam Shepard</a>), but he vibrates with the reckless spirit of the man. <a href=#>John C. Reilly</a> plays the hapless Noah Dietrich, his right-hand man and flunky, routinely ordered to mortgage everything for one of Hughes' sudden inspirations; Hughes apparently became the world's richest man by going bankrupt at higher and higher levels.</p><p>Scorsese shows a sure sense for the Hollywood of that time, as in a scene where Howard, new in town, approaches the mogul L.B. Mayer at the Coconut Grove and asks to borrow two cameras for a big "Hells' Angels" scene. He already had 24, but that was not enough. Mayer regards him as a child psychiatrist might have regarded the young <a href=#>Jim Carrey</a>. Scorsese adds subtle continuity: Every time we see Mayer, he seems to be surrounded by the same flunkies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lkau2osDOq2RraGBp</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ryan-lewis-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Ryan Lewis Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
