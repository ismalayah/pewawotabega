Over the course of three gorgeous releases — and then a full trilogy of prequels — Jackson led a talented cast through the process of introducing and fleshing out a rich, wondrous world full of elves, dwarves, Hobbits, and dragons.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=334 data-current-count=334 data-injectable=false>One character was there through each of the six films set in Middle-earth, despite the decades that pass between each trilogy’s setting. Gandalf the Grey — later known as Gandalf the White — is a mainstay in J.R.R. Tolkien’s world, proving himself time and again to be a wise and capable guide, advisor, and companion.</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=687 data-injectable=true>The transformation that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gandalf</a> undergoes in the second Lord of the Rings film, following his fall in the Mines of Moria, remains a confusing part of his journey for many viewers. Experts on Tolkien’s fascinating, but often dense, lore are well aware of how the fan-favorite wizard cinched his promotion, but many casual viewers remain uncertain.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-gandalf data-injectable=false>Who is Gandalf?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gandalf-1.jpg><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=637 data-injectable=true>Gandalf’s transformation from “the Grey” to “the White” happens off-screen, for the most part, leaving a number of viewers perplexed as to how the wizard made the shift. A bit of background, lovingly crafted by Tolkien and scattered throughout his many releases, helps provide context for the metamorphosis.</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gandalf</a> is one of the Maiar, a collection of primordial spirits sent to join the Valar in their efforts to shape the world. He was there from the very beginning, helping to make changes as the world slowly developed, and is widely considered the wisest of his kind.</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=509 data-injectable=true>He, along with four other Maiar, eventually became the five incarnated wizards — or Istari — we know from the books. Three of these wizards — Gandalf, Saruman, and Radagast — make appearances in the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films.</p><h2 id=h-how-else-was-gandalf-known data-injectable=false>How else was Gandalf known?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-8.png><p data-characters=418 data-current-count=718 data-injectable=true>The being that eventually became <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gandalf the Grey</a> was once known by other names, some of which crop up in popular Lord of the Rings releases. He became known by his primary moniker through the Hobbit trilogy and Fellowship of the Ring following the inception of the Third Age, cloaking himself in tattered grey robes and taking on the appearance of an elderly man in hopes of concealing his true power from the world.</p><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=181 data-injectable=false>His somewhat shabby appearance is entirely purposeful — as is Radagast’s — and helps to separate these cautious, humble wizards from their far more conceited counterparts.</p><h2 id=h-how-did-gandalf-the-grey-become-gandalf-the-white data-injectable=false>How did Gandalf the Grey become Gandalf the White?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-9.png><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=269 data-injectable=false>Following Gandalf’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">battle with the Balrog</a>, which sees both ancient beings plummet into the depths of the Mines of Moria, he was reborn as Gandalf the White. This transformation was prompted by a number of things, the first of which was Saruman’s betrayal.</p><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=720 data-injectable=true>Once the leader of the Istari order and of the White Council, Saruman’s will was gradually corrupted during his time in Middle-earth. He eventually becomes seduced by the dark side, as it were — Christopher Lee has a weakness for it, apparently — as he senses Sauron’s power growing from afar. He eventually became a willing slave to Sauron’s will, forming a massive Orc army in preparation for what he saw as an inevitable war.</p><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>Saruman’s treachery eventually comes to light and prompts his ejection from the White Council and Istari order. By this time he had already rebranded himself as Saruman of the Many Colors — in proper Pride Month fashion — leaving the coveted position at the head of the White Council vacant. Gandalf eventually stepped in to fill this role.</p><p data-characters=551 data-current-count=902 data-injectable=true>The second factor that contributed to Gandalf’s transformation came after his death at the hands of the Balrog. While Gandalf did manage to defeat the ancient beast, he too fell following their lengthy battle, straying “out of thought and time.” He remained tethered to Middle-earth, even as his spirit wandered, and the wounded wizard was eventually brought to Lothlórien. There, the elves saw his wounds healed and draped Gandalf in white, presenting him with a new, powerful staff to aid in his continued service to Middle-earth.</p><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>Thus, he became Gandalf the White, elevated in his position in the White Council, and the last remaining Valar emissary in Middle-earth. This heightened position also allowed Gandalf to unveil more of his hidden Maiar power but never swayed him from his original mission: to aid and empower the people of Middle-earth and to see the evil of Sauron permanently purged from the land he loves.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXZm2pXnGmqWdmZyberW0xGaeq5mpYq%2Bmr86mnGafkaOxorjFZquhnV2starAxGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amy-paffrath.html><span>←</span><span>Amy Paffrath, an actress and TV host with $1 million net worth is married to actor Drew Seeley and t</span></a>
