He succeeds him as emperor and marries his daughter Princess Irulan to strengthen his rule. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">This instigates a holy war</a>, with some elements within the former government challenging Paul’s rule and him sending forth his Fedaykin warriors to crush the resistance.</p><p data-characters=574 data-current-count=574 data-injectable=true>Years and the deaths of billions of people across the galaxy later, Paul finds himself cornered by enemies who are plotting against his rule in Dune Messiah. Meanwhile, his concubine Chani is pregnant with his children, but Princess Irulan is scheming to have her killed. At the end of the book, Chani succumbs to illness after giving birth to twins, and Paul, having been blinded by the attempt on his life, decides to abdicate and leave for the desert like his Fremen brothers. Paul designates his sister Alia as a regent until his children, Leto and Ghanima, come of age.</p><p data-characters=697 data-current-count=697 data-injectable=true>Children of Dune picks up the story nine years after Dune Messiah. Alia has succumbed to Abomination and is being possessed by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen’s ego spirit. At the same time, a new religious figure called The Preacher emerges from Arrakis and speaks out against the Atreides empire. It is ultimately revealed that The Preacher is none other than Paul Atreides himself, who somehow survived his self-imposed sacrifice and continues to protect the interests of the Fremen and advocates for peace. Paul and Leto meet up, with the latter accessing the ancestral memories and choosing the Golden Path to ensure humanity’s ultimate survival — something his father refused to do years ago.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>Paul and Leto go to the capital to confront Alia. The Preacher gives one final speech against his possessed sister, which causes a riot to break out. In the chaos that ensues, Alia’s loyalist priests repeatedly stab Paul to death, thus bringing a final end to the Lisan al Gaib.</p><p data-characters=190 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=false>Leto declares himself emperor and doubles down on the Golden Path, noting to another character Farad’n Corrino (grandson of Shaddam IV) that he is going to live for thousands of years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXZm8pr%2BMqZiupF2WwbOxyJ2crGWUnrJutc1mm66mlWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./adhyayan-suman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-587013-html.html><span>←</span><span>Adhyayan Suman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
