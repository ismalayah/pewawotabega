<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Kuso movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2017)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Produced over the course of two-and-a-half years, "Kuso" is a roiling stew of Flying Lotus's creative influences, some of whom have cameos in the film, like Heidecker and Funkadelic/Parliament co-founder <a href=#>George Clinton</a>. All the events you see&nbsp;are somehow precipitated&nbsp;by a catastrophic Los Angeles earthquake. Beyond that, the only thing&nbsp;holding these scenes together are Ellison's&nbsp;recurring fixations with scab-and-pustule-encrusted nebbishes, and insects that emerge from rectal orifices. Watching "Kuso" consequently feels like an excavation of the many subterranean chambers of Ellison's anally-fixated imagination.&nbsp;</p><p>A bald child with facial deformities eats and prays with his grotesque mother, then ventures into the woods and rubs his own waste on the mysterious creature that inhabits a mossy knoll that looks like a gaping anus. Click. A Japanese woman tumbles down a hole, and discovers herself in a hellish underworld where her legs are somehow attached to a stranger's limbs. Click. A marijuana-addled woman puzzles over news that she's pregnant&nbsp;and fends off advances from two&nbsp;inter-dimensional alien roommates who look like sentient shag carpets. Click. A&nbsp;red computer-generated steam of what looks like bloody diarrhea hangs and undulates in the air. Click. Paper cut-outs and computer-generated images of Hieronymous-Bosch-like hellscapes are nested within human heads trapped in&nbsp;eyeballs trapped in skulls trapped in mouths. Click.&nbsp;A musician, played by Ellison, tries to banish his irrational fear of mammaries by having Clinton, playing a holistic doctor named Dr. Clinton, have a bug that lives inside Clinton's posterior spray him with psychedelic excrement. Cl--</p><p>Wait, what was that last one?&nbsp;</p><p>Your brain struggles to make connections between these segments because each subplot is broken down into three -to five episodes each, cut up, and spread out over the course of the film. But the diced-up juxtaposition of these&nbsp;segments necessarily prevents them from&nbsp;gelling together, so they&nbsp;never cohere into a bigger picture. I can commend Ellison for singular set pieces, like the film's inspired opening musical number, or a weirdly intimate early&nbsp;sex scene. I could also lament dismal gags, like anything involving Heidecker, a blow-up doll, and aliens.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46krKynXWd9coM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-jannis-niewohner-girlfriend-emilia-schule-net-worth-earnings-family.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Jannis Niewhner Girlfriend Emilia Schle?
