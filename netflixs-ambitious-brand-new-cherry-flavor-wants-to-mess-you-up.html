The increasingly great Salazar (“Undone,” “<a href=#>Alita: Battle Angel</a>”) does the best work yet of her career as Lisa Nova, a young filmmaker who has come to Los Angeles with dreams of bringing her visions to life. Before she gets the chance, she’s beset upon by a predator named Lou Burke (<a href=#>Eric Lange</a>), a power player who promises to make her dreams come true but ends up being truly evil. Lisa turns to a mysterious figure named Boro (<a href=#>Catherine Keener</a>) to get revenge, and then things get really weird. <a href=#>Manny Jacinto</a>, having a great month with this and “Nine Perfect Strangers” co-stars, and then the great character actor <a href=#>Patrick Fischler</a> shows up later in the season to remind viewers even more of one of Lynch’s masterpieces.</p><p>“Brand New Cherry Flavor” is almost impossible to adequately describe in narrative terms. Lisa starts vomiting kittens. There are actual zombies. A character from Lisa’s past returns in a subplot clearly designed to bring to mind “Saint Joan” and <a href=#>Jean Seberg</a> (and the on-set trauma) for movie fans. Keener is the source of most of the magical stuff and I’m not fully convinced by every acting decision this typically strong performer makes here, especially early in the series when she seems to be playing weird a bit too directly, but Salazar always brings the show back into focus, even when it’s narratively going off the rails. She’s a fantastically present performer, selling the surreal aspects of Lisa’s journey without overplaying them with melodrama. She seems to be actually thinking, feeling, and responding instead of winking at the audience. It’s essential to the success of the show that it has a center that holds while everything goes mad around it, and Salazar understands that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/6113d6d7b8b50d056f2db57b/content_BNCF_107_Unit_01552RC.jpg><p>The first half of the season focuses a bit too heavily on just the battle between Lou and Lisa, but the shows gets stronger as it spins off into stranger flights of fancy in the second half, including a visit to Boro’s past and the aforementioned former of collaborator of Lisa’s. The old joke about Los Angeles is that no one was actually born there, coming to the city of angels from small towns around the world, bringing their own baggage on the trip. “Brand New Cherry Flavor” captures this feeling of displaced trauma, people who struggle to make connections as they run from demons they left in their wake. And yet it’s not a depressing show, often coming to life in gory, fascinating flights of humor and wit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmrKyimq6utc2gZqedpJu5qsTSZpimmpmptrDB0maZq5memXqvsdZmmqGdoqfGbrLLmq2oql2srq%2FA0marqGWdmsC0ediorGatoA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./reggie-barlow-age-wiki-biography-salary-net-worth-family-body-measurement-parents.html><span>←</span><span>Reggie Barlow Age, Wiki, Biography, Salary, Net worth, Family, Body Measurement, Parents</span></a>
