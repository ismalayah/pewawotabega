Following news of his death, Williams’ most popular roles — from Hair and 1941 to Chicago Fire — became highly sought-after, as viewers searched for their favorite Williams moments to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ease the pain of his loss</a>. More than any other role, it seems people are eagerly seeking out old episodes of Everwood, the program that helped define Williams’ career and earned him two nominations for the&nbsp;Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance in a Drama Series. Dr. Andrew Brown was a vital element of the show, and people are looking back fondly on his four-year tenure on the WB program.</p><h2 id=h-where-to-watch-everwood-for-free data-injectable=false>Where to watch Everwood for free</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=583 data-injectable=true>Everwood‘s been off the air since 2006, and few viewers are likely to catch re-aired episodes anytime soon. Thankfully, the era of streaming makes older shows easier to track down, and there are a number of potential options for catching each of the show’s four seasons.</p><p data-characters=514 data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true>There’s presently only one free streaming option for penny-saving Everwood fans, but those with a few extra bucks have some additional paid options. If you’re looking to enjoy the series for free, head over to Freevee, which <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Just Watch</a> reports has the entire series available at no cost. If you don’t have access to Freevee, or if you’d like to enjoy the show without ads, viewers can also enjoy it with a subscription to Apple TV, or they can buy it up from Vudu for around $25 a season.</p><p data-characters=486 data-current-count=486 data-injectable=false>Williams played Dr. Andrew Brown on the series, alongside a number of enduringly popular stars. There’s no beating the star power of Chris Pratt, who — despite controversy — continues to headline several major franchises, but fellow stars Gregory Smith, Sarah Drew, and Scott Wolf are no slouches either. Despite the clear prominence of celebs like Pratt, Williams persists as the most popular actor on Everwood, and that status seems poised to maintain even after his death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMSrnGabkaN6qnnWmqucoF2aw6a%2B1qimnWWWpL9ustGenGaqlaKyrq7Eq6Cnn12pv6at02auoqScnq6uv4ydqWaZnpm%2FpsOMm6mor55k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mindhunter-fans-mourn-as-season-3-hopes-squashed-by-david-fincher.html><span>←</span><span>Mindhunter fans mourn as season 3 hopes squashed by David Fincher</span></a>
